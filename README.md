# Ersoy Kardesler ISO

A Linux-libre ISO image build script based on [Minimal Linux Script](https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal-linux-script).

Copyright (C) 2016-2021 John Davidson, 2021-2022 Ercan Ersoy and Erdem Ersoy

The source bundles are downloaded and compiled automatically. The script requires host toolchain.

If you are using [Pardus](https://www.pardus.org.tr), [Debian](https://www.debian.org) or [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), you should be able to resolve all build dependencies by executing the following command:

    sudo apt install wget make gawk gcc bc bison flex xorriso libelf-dev libssl-dev

The script doesn't require root privileges. In the end you should have a bootable ISO image named `ersoy_kardesler.iso` in the same directory where you executed the script.
